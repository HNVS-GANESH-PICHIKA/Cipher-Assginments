# Cipher Assignments

This repository contains various C++ programs focused on implementing different types of ciphers and encryption techniques. The aim of this project is to provide an understanding of how ciphers work and their implementations in C++.

## Description

The project includes assignments related to ciphers, specifically focusing on:

- **Caesar Cipher**: A basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
- **Substitution Cipher**: An encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

The program in `ques1.cpp` implements one of these ciphers (please specify which one it is), demonstrating its functionality and usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- A text editor or an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HNVS-GANESH-PICHIKA/Cipher-Assginments.git
